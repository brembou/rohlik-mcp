**Enhance your favourite LLM with capabilities to buy groceries.**

> [!WARNING]
> This MCP server is made for study purposes with use of reverse engineered Rohlik API. It is for personal use only.

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to interact with the Rohlik Group's online grocery delivery services across multiple countries. This server provides tools for searching products, managing shopping carts, and accessing account info.

**Supported Services:**
- ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ **[Rohlik.cz](https://www.rohlik.cz)** - Czech Republic
- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **[Knuspr.de](https://www.knuspr.de)** - Germany  
- ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹ **[Gurkerl.at](https://www.gurkerl.at)** - Austria
- ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º **[Kifli.hu](https://www.kifli.hu)** - Hungary
- ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´ **[Sezamo.ro](https://www.sezamo.ro)** - Romania
- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ **[Sezamo.it](https://www.sezamo.it)** - Italy (planned)
- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ **[Sezamo.es](https://www.sezamo.es)** - Spain (planned)

Example LLM prompts that work very well with the Rohlik MCP:

**ðŸ›’ Regular Shopping:**
- *Add ingredients for apple pie to the cart. Only gluten-free and budget-friendly.*
- *Or actually, instead of apple pie I want to make pumpkin pie. Change the ingredients.*
- *What are the items in my cart?*
- *Add the items in the attached shopping list photo to the cart.*
- *Add the bread I marked as favorite in Rohlik to my cart.*

**ðŸ¤– Smart Shopping:**
- *"Add breakfast items I typically order"*
- *"Show me lunch suggestions for this week"*
- *"What do I usually buy for dinner?"*
- *"I need snacks - suggest what I normally order"*
- *"Show my top 20 most purchased items"*
- *"What can I do with Rohlik MCP?"*

**ðŸ“… Planning:**
- *What are the cheapest delivery slots for tomorrow?*
- *When is my next delivery?*

## Usage

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add the MCP to Claude Desktop configuration:
- On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rohlik": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@tomaspavlin/rohlik-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ROHLIK_USERNAME": "your-email@example.com",
        "ROHLIK_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "ROHLIK_BASE_URL": "https://www.rohlik.cz"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Supported Regions

The server supports multiple Rohlik regions by setting the `ROHLIK_BASE_URL` environment variable:

* **Czech Republic**: `https://www.rohlik.cz` (default)
* **Germany**: `https://www.knuspr.de`
* **Austria**: `https://www.gurkerl.at`
* **Hungary**: `https://www.kifli.hu`
* **Romania**: `https://www.sezamo.ro`
* **Italy** (planned): `https://www.sezamo.it`
* **Spain** (planned): `https://www.sezamo.es`

If `ROHLIK_BASE_URL` is not specified, it defaults to the Czech version.

- Price averaging and calculations
- Category filtering and grouping
- Edge cases (empty data, missing fields, etc.)

See [tests/README.md](./tests/README.md) for detailed testing documentation.

### Testing with Claude Desktop

Add this to configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rohlik-local": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/rohlik-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "ROHLIK_USERNAME": "your-email@example.com",
        "ROHLIK_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "ROHLIK_BASE_URL": "https://www.rohlik.cz"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Debug Mode

If you're experiencing authentication issues, enable debug mode to see detailed logs:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rohlik-local": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/rohlik-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "ROHLIK_USERNAME": "your-email@example.com",
        "ROHLIK_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "ROHLIK_BASE_URL": "https://www.rohlik.cz",
        "ROHLIK_DEBUG": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Debug logs will appear in `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-rohlik-local.log` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%/Claude/logs/mcp-server-rohlik-local.log` (Windows).

### Testing with MCP Inspector

You can test the MCP server using the official MCP Inspector (https://modelcontextprotocol.io/legacy/tools/inspector):

```bash
npm run inspect
```

In the Inspector, set the ROHLIK_USERNAME and ROHLIK_PASSWORD envs.

### API Validation Tool

To validate that all Rohlik API endpoints are working correctly and diagnose authentication issues:

```bash
npm run validate-api
```

This will:
- Test all 11 API endpoints used by the MCP server
- Show detailed HTTP request/response logs in the console
- Generate a JSON report: `tests/validation-results.json`
- Generate a beautiful HTML report: `tests/validation-report.html`

The validator automatically loads credentials from your Claude Desktop config or environment variables. Open the HTML report in your browser for an easy-to-read summary of all tests.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Login failed" Error

**Possible causes:**
1. Wrong username/password in configuration
2. Rohlik API changed or is temporarily unavailable
3. Network connectivity issues

**Solutions:**
1. Verify credentials in your `claude_desktop_config.json`
2. Enable debug mode: `"ROHLIK_DEBUG": "true"` in env section
3. Check logs: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-rohlik*.log` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp-server-rohlik*.log` (Windows)
4. Run API validator: `npm run validate-api` to test all endpoints

#### "No order history found"

**Cause:** Your account has no past orders, or orders are not accessible

**Solution:** Ensure you have at least one completed order on Rohlik before using smart shopping features (`get_meal_suggestions`, `get_frequent_items`)

#### Slow response times

**Causes:**
- Analyzing too many orders (smart shopping features)
- Network latency to Rohlik servers
- API rate limiting

**Solutions:**
- For smart shopping: reduce number of orders analyzed (try 10 instead of default 20)
- Use fewer requests or add delays between bulk operations
- Check your network connection

#### Products not found or search returns no results

**Causes:**
- Product out of stock or discontinued
- Product ID changed in Rohlik system
- Spelling mistake in search query

**Solutions:**
- Search by partial name instead of full product name
- Try alternative spellings or broader search terms
- Verify product exists on Rohlik website directly

### Enabling Debug Mode

Add `ROHLIK_DEBUG` to your configuration to see detailed logs:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rohlik-local": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/rohlik-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "ROHLIK_USERNAME": "your-email@example.com",
        "ROHLIK_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "ROHLIK_BASE_URL": "https://www.rohlik.cz",
        "ROHLIK_DEBUG": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**View logs:**
```bash
# macOS
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-rohlik-local.log

# Windows
type %APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp-server-rohlik-local.log
```

### Using the API Validation Tool

If you encounter authentication or API issues, run the validator:

```bash
npm run validate-api
```

This will:
- Test all 11 API endpoints used by the MCP
- Show detailed HTTP request/response information
- Generate `validation-results.json` with test results
- Create `validation-report.html` for easy viewing in browser
- Help identify which specific endpoints are failing
